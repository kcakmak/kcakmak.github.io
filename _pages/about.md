* I am in the job market and my job market paper is ["Optimal Pricing and Product Returns"](/files/KadircanCakmak_JobMarketPaper_OptimalPricingandProductReturns.pdf).

Abstract: E-commerce has provided consumers with the opportunity to evaluate a product's search attributes prior to purchase. At the same time, its experience attributes, e.g., personal feel and fit, can often not be fully evaluated online without physical inspection and are only revealed after purchase upon delivery. To offset this difficulty, e-commerce retailers and online marketplaces offer lenient return policies to consumers who feel that the goods they bought disappoint. Using a novel data set of transactions and customer returns at a large online marketplace in the apparel industry, we document that product return rates in the apparel industry are high, ranging from about 5% to about 45% of purchases for a given product. In addition, return rates causally depend on the prices paid. We conceptualize how pricing decisions are affected by returns through (1) return rates, and (2) their dependence on price. Estimating a choice-based model of demand that includes product returns, we show that ignoring product returns severely biases estimates of demand and may lead to incorrect pricing decisions. Incorporating product preferences, (price-dependent) return rates, and return costs in the profit function, we show how to solve for optimal prices. While return costs push prices up by increasing the marginal costs, larger price elasticities of sales net of returns pull prices down. Finally, we show how prices, return costs and profits change in equilibrium.
